# Hi there 👋, I'm Alberto Delgado
Computer Science Master's student at USF

# A bit about myself
I'm a full stack developer with a passion for coding, innovation and learning new technologies. I love building from IoT projects to beautiful applications and anything in between.

I grew up in Spain, where I studied electrical engineering that gave me a great foundation for understanding the nuts and bolts of modern technology. After almost 5 years of work experience building full stack web applications and building exciting side projects I am now a student at the University of San Francisco studying a Masters in Computer Science to sharpen my skills.

In my spare time I like to rock climb, read and play the guitar!


## Side projects
I love building side projects in my spare time. And when I say building, I mean it very literally. You will see what I mean down below. These are just some of the ones I most enjoyed.
