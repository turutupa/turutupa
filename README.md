# A bit about myself
I'm a full stack developer with a passion for coding, innovation and learning new technologies. I love building from IoT projects to beautiful applications and anything in between.

I grew up in Spain, where I studied electrical engineering that gave me a great foundation for understanding the nuts and bolts of modern technology. After almost 5 years of work experience building full stack web applications and building exciting side projects I am now a student at the University of San Francisco studying a Masters in Computer Science to sharpen my skills.

In my spare time I like to rock climb, read and play the guitar!


# Side projects
I love building side projects in my spare time. And when I say building, I mean it very literally. You will see what I mean down below. These are just some of the ones I most enjoyed. 

## üëªüí° <ins>SpookyBulb -  _Online pong game!_ 
Have you seen the episode in The Big Bang Theory were the gang lets people from the internet control their lights? I loved the concept and wanted to create something similar myself! So it occurred to me, how cool would it be if people were to FIGHT over the internet in order to gain control over my spooky bulb?

Needless to say my weekend project turned into a 2 weekend project but I couldn't be happier wit the result!
Github repo: https://github.com/turutupa/spookyBulb

**How does it work?** Raspberry Pi! Everything was hosted in my raspy which exposed the video to the internet, interfaced with the arduino, managed the player lobbies and hosted the front end to allow users to control the pong paddles. 

### Demo

## üí¶ü™¥ <ins>Smart Water Plant
I came with a simple but fun smart irrigation voice-controlled solution. Simply say, _Ok google, water my plant!_ and a pump will do it for you. You can also ask Google, what is the moisture humidity percentage? I suppose it could be automated so you don't have to interact with it at all, but it wouldn't be just as fun!

**How does it work?** I used an ESP8266, similar to an Arduino but it has blue-tooth and WiFi on board. The micro-controller connects to my home's WiFi and over it I can send commands using mqtt. The ESP8266 also has a moisture sensor that reads the % humidity. I used [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) for the voice commands. You can also check the github repo with some other programs: https://github.com/turutupa/iot

Although it never evolved to anything else than a prototype, here is a picture of the final version!  I actually bought a solar panel to make it completely autonomous but is still in my to-do list.

## üèê‚öôÔ∏è <ins>SAP Great Ball Contraption!
This is an awesome project I worked on during my times at SAP! It took an unbelievable amount of time to simply put all the pieces together. The balls go around the contraption simulating the different stages at a factory. Each ball is tracked using sensors and displayed in a screen.
